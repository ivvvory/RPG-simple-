    biased coin roll:
    This function simulates a biased coin flip. The coin has a given bias (probability of heads).
    A value of `bias` between 0 and 1 determines the probability of heads.

    Parameters:
    - bias (float): Probability of getting "heads" (0 <= bias <= 1).

    Returns:
    - "heads" or "tails" based on the bias.

    coin class object:
    Initializes a Coin object with base and heads coin power based on its level.

    Parameters:
    - level (int): The level of the coin (1 to 10).


    heads coin power
    Calculates the heads coin power based on the coin's level.
    The heads power scales from 10 to 34 as level increases from 1 to 10.

    Parameters:
    - level (int): The level of the coin (1 to 10).

    Returns:
    - (int): The heads coin power based on the coin's level.


    peform attack:
    Calculates the total attack power based on the ability and coin's level.

    Parameters:
    - ability (str): The selected attack ability ("strike", "slash", "rush") example attacks, change later
    - coin_level (int): The level of the coin (1 to 10).

    Returns:
    - (int): The total attack power calculated based on the number of heads.

    simulate attacks:
    Simulates an attack based on pre-determined coin level and user-selected attack ability.
    The function will prompt the user for the attack type and use a fixed coin level.
